Above is a cpp implementation of the paper by someone on gh, and then mine in js.

My implementation is for 2d. But generalize the code to have a choice whether to have a 2d or 3d canvas. Note that you will need to have to update kernel function to work for 2d and 3d (3d is cross product, whereas 2d is just a det), A_bar (for 3d) is 3|V | Ã— 3|V |  matrix, instead of 2, and so on so forth. Also generalize graph creation, and other funcitons on your discretion. and of course Review the code from cpp and paper snippet carefully and apply it to 3d part of js. you must provide full code without simplifications.
